so a user can add another user to commit in his repository by adding him to our collaborators in github and later he can provide us his public key-file to upload on our github keypairs so that he can connect to our github using his private key file

git init 
git add .
git ./
git add README.MD --> saving the changes into temp/stagig area
git commit -m "First time commit" --> commiting the changes into local repo
1> token based git push origin master/main
git config --global user.email "info@joindevops.com"     --> we need a user email to understand who did this change
git config --global user.name "sivakumarreddy"
git remote add origin https://github.com/Aditya-DevReleaseup/Shell-Scripts-Ec2.git
git push -m  
/ add repository url using origin(points to remote repo default main branch)

2> SSH Authentication to GitHub
ssh -i <private-key> username@IP/domain-name

3. git push origin master --> pushing the changes to central repository have two methods
1. token based
2. SSH based

1. create repo in central, and work with it
2. you have existing folder, how can you push

Github ssh method 

add a public key to the server 
make .ssh folder in users(current user that we are going to use terminal) dir 
give the private key file url in config file under c/users/ssh/config
give the data of url of private key file like under  ~/.ssh/private
connect = #ssh -i private-key username@IP    /automatically taken private file from .ssh directory
add remote repo using ssh url from github repo under code 
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Aditya-DevReleaseup/Shell-Scripts-Ec2.git
